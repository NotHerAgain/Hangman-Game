# Hangman-Game
I have been learning how to use JavaScript via FreeCodeCamp, so looking at forking a few projects to get used to using it and what it all means!

Here, I forked a Youtube Video to create a Hangman game. 
I made my own pictures in paint (because I'm so cool...!)
Original video is by Simon Suh via Youtube:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgvyE1sJS3Y

Tadah!
